# CLAUDE-PLUGINS.md

Architectural reference for **Maestro Plugins** - the third-party extension system whose pure contracts live in `src/shared/plugins/` and whose main-process runtime lives in `src/main/plugins/`. For the practical authoring guide (how to write a plugin, full manifest reference, worked examples), see [docs/agent-guides/PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/agent-guides/PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT.md). This doc is the **why** and the **gotchas** - read it before changing anything in `src/main/plugins/` or `src/shared/plugins/`.

## 30-second mental model

A plugin is one folder under `<userData>/plugins/` containing a `plugin.json` manifest. Plugins come in three trust tiers: tier 0 is data-only (declarative contributions, no code), tier 1 runs sandboxed code, tier 2 adds sandboxed UI. The whole feature is behind the `plugins` Encore flag (off by default). At startup the `PluginManager` discovers folders, validates each manifest, checks host-API compatibility and signature, and applies a persisted enable toggle. Tier 0 contributions (themes, prompts, settings, command macros, cue triggers) feed host registries directly. A tier-1 plugin stays disabled until the user enables it and consents to its capabilities; on enable, the `PluginSandboxHost` forks one Electron `utilityProcess` per plugin and runs the plugin's `entry` code in a `vm` context. Every host call the plugin makes is an RPC that the `PermissionBroker` authorizes (default deny) before a host handler executes it. UI panels render in a locked-down sandboxed iframe whose only channel out is a single narrow `postMessage` bridge.

## Status / gating

- Entire system is gated on `encoreFeatures.plugins === true` (off by default), re-read per call.
- Every `plugins:*` IPC channel throws the sentinel `'PluginsDisabled'` when the flag is off, so the renderer can distinguish "feature off" from "no plugins installed". The gate runs OUTSIDE `withIpcErrorLogging` so the sentinel is not logged as a real failure.
- `PluginManager.getActiveRecords()`, `getContributions()`, and `getAgentRegistry()` all return empty when the flag is off, regardless of what is on disk.
- `HOST_API_VERSION = '1.16.0'` (`src/shared/plugins/host-api.ts`) is the single source of truth for the host surface version.

## Tiers

`PluginTier` is `0 | 1 | 2` (`plugin-manifest.ts`).

- **Tier 0 - data only.** Declarative contributions, NO code. `entry` is forbidden. Lowest risk. Auto-enables on discovery.
- **Tier 1 - sandboxed compute.** Runs `entry` code in an isolated `utilityProcess` behind the permission broker. `entry` is required.
- **Tier 2 - UI contributions.** Sandboxed panels / modals / commands. Also a code tier (`tier >= 1`), so `entry` is required.

Loadability is gated by `isHostApiCompatible(minHostApi, hostVersion)`: absent `minHostApi` is compatible; invalid semver is NOT; the major must match exactly; within a major the host must be `>=` the declared minimum.

## Lifecycle (`plugin-manager.ts`)

```
discover folders under pluginsDir()
  -> read + validate plugin.json (validatePluginManifest)
  -> host-API compat check (isHostApiCompatible)
  -> signature verify (verifyPluginSignature)
  -> apply persisted enable toggle
       (tier 0 auto-enables on first discovery; tier >= 1 stays DISABLED
        until the user enables = consents; a stored toggle always wins)
  -> reconcileSandboxes(): start runnable tier-1 children, stop the rest
```

- `refresh()` rebuilds the registry from disk and is the ONLY place sandboxes are reconciled and `onChange` (-> `plugins:changed`) fires. It re-reads disk so manual installs/removes are picked up.
- `isRunnable(record)` = `enabled && loadStatus === 'ok' && manifest && tier >= 1 && entry && signature.status !== 'invalid'`. Tampered (`invalid`) code is NEVER run.
- `install(sourceDir)` copies a source folder into `pluginsDir()/<id>`, rejecting an invalid manifest, an id collision, or any symlink in the tree (a symlink could escape the plugin dir).
- `uninstall(id)` stops the sandbox, removes the dir (only inside `pluginsDir()`), then purges everything the plugin owns: enable toggle (`forgetPlugin`), grants (`forgetGrants`), and via `purgePluginData` its KV store, `plugins.<id>.*` settings, and live event subscriptions. Uninstall leaves nothing behind.

## Tier-1 runtime: sandbox + broker + handlers

   v
HostRequest { id, method, params }  ---postMessage--->  PluginSandboxHost (main)
                                                          | validate method + shape, cap size
                                                          v
                                              PermissionBroker.authorize()   default DENY
                                                          | allowed?
                                                          v
                                              host handler (plugin-host-handlers.ts)
                                                          | result / error
                                                          v
HostResponse { id, ok, result?, error? } <---postMessage---
```

- **Sandbox host (`plugin-sandbox-host.ts`).** One `utilityProcess` per running tier-1 plugin (process + crash isolation). It treats the child as hostile: validates the method against `HOST_METHODS`, caps a single message at `MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES = 1_000_000` (1 MB), enforces `MAX_IN_FLIGHT = 32` concurrent calls and a sliding window of `RATE_MAX_PER_WINDOW = 200` per `RATE_WINDOW_MS = 1000`, and never evaluates anything the child sends. Teardown sends a `shutdown` control message then hard-kills after `SHUTDOWN_GRACE_MS = 2000`.
- **The SDK (`plugin-sandbox-entry.ts` `buildSdk`).** A frozen object; every method is a thin broker-gated RPC (`hostCall`). There is no direct host access. Method->capability mapping is the data-driven `HOST_API` table in `rpc-protocol.ts`; the broker reads `HOST_METHOD_CAPABILITY` from it.
- **Broker (`permission-broker.ts`).** Resolves the required capability and the call's target (`extractTarget`), then checks live grants with `isPermitted`. It does NOT execute - the sandbox host runs the handler only after `authorize` returns allowed. Grants are re-read each call via `getGrants` so a revoke takes effect immediately. Authorization is separate from execution so the gate is unit-testable without Electron or fs.
- **Handlers (`plugin-host-handlers.ts`).** The real implementations. Highlights:
  - `fs.read` / `fs.write`: resolve the symlink-real path, then RE-authorize it against the broker (`authorizeRealPath`) so a symlink inside a granted scope cannot escape, and the userData/config tree (`protectedPaths`) is denied even under a broad grant. Caps: `MAX_READ_BYTES = 10_000_000`; writes run under the `ActionGuard`.
  - `net.fetch`: `EgressGuard.assertUrlAllowed` blocks loopback / link-local / RFC1918 / cloud-metadata (169.254.169.254) / the app's own loopback port BEFORE any socket opens; fails closed if the connection-pinning dispatcher is unavailable; forces `redirect: 'error'` so a 3xx cannot be followed to a non-granted host; caps the body at `MAX_FETCH_BYTES = 5_000_000`. Returns `{ status, statusText, headers, body }`.
  - `settings.get`: denies secret-looking keys (`SECRET_KEY_PATTERN`), the `encoreFeatures` gate, and any `plugins.<other>.*` namespace that is not the caller's own.
  - `settings.set`: only `plugins.<id>.*` keys; same secret/proto/gate guards; value must be JSON-storable and `<= MAX_SETTINGS_VALUE_BYTES = 64 * 1024`.
  - `sessions.list` / `sessions.get`: projected through `toSessionMetadata` - metadata only, never transcript/prompt text.
  - `sessions.focus`: navigation only, gated by the narrow `sessions:focus` capability (NOT `tabs:manage`, which also carries create/close). Closed `{ sessionId, tabId? }` schema, `assertBrokerAllowed`, unknown sessionId throws. Implemented main-side like `pluginTabsFocus`: both verbs share `pluginAiFocusFields()` (`index.ts`), the main-side mirror of the renderer's `aiTabFocusFields()`, so the jump lands on the AI tab and nulls `activeGroupId` (a focused tiled group would otherwise keep owning the panel). No `tabId` -> the session's current AI tab, else its first; an explicit `tabId` that is not one of THAT session's AI tabs is rejected.
  - `transcripts.read`: PROJECTED session content - the caller declares which fields it needs and only allowlisted fields are returned (projection, not redaction). Resolves the session's REAL `projectPath` and RE-authorizes against it (the caller-claimed path is only a broker hint), refuses an untrusted plugin that also holds `net:fetch`/`net:connect`/`process:spawn` (the exfiltration combination), runs under the `ActionGuard` (high-risk rate/concurrency cap), and writes a per-read audit line. The metadata-only event bus is untouched.
  - `storage.*`: per-plugin KV via `kvStore` (values are strings).
  - `events.subscribe` / `unsubscribe`: filtered to the fixed `PLUGIN_EVENT_TOPICS` catalog. Includes `tool.executed`, a metadata-only tool-lifecycle event (tool name + timing, never arguments or results), and `session.activated` `{ sessionId, tabId? }`, emitted from the `sessions:setActiveSessionId` handler with its own 100ms trailing debounce (separate from that handler's 400ms disk-write debounce) and skipped when the focused session did not actually change.
  - `agents.dispatch` and `process.spawn`: LIVE but fully gated. Each registers only when `deps.dispatch` / `deps.spawn` are injected (both are wired in `index.ts`). Every call runs the gate stack: allowlist-scope grant (`assertBrokerAllowed`), trusted signature (`assertTrustedActVerb`), Pianola risk ceiling (`assertLowOrMediumRisk`), a closed input schema, and the `ActionGuard` rate/concurrency cap. `agents.dispatch` ADDITIONALLY requires the separate unattended consent (see below) because plugin-initiated dispatch is never user-present.
  - `net.connect` / `net.send` / `net.close`: LIVE, trusted-only persistent outbound WebSocket. Registers only when `deps.netConnect` is injected. `wss:` only; the connect is pinned through the same `EgressGuard` lookup as `net.fetch` (loopback / RFC1918 / link-local / metadata blocked); caps at `MAX_SOCKETS_PER_PLUGIN = 4` per plugin and `MAX_FRAME_BYTES = 64 KB` per frame in both directions; `send`/`close` re-authorize the still-held host grant on every call so a mid-stream revoke denies the next call. The host owns the real socket; the plugin gets a `socketId` handle and receives frames as `net.connect:<socketId>` topic events (via `pushEvent`, not the `PLUGIN_EVENT_TOPICS` catalog). Sockets are force-closed on disable / crash / uninstall.
  - `ui.panelPost`: requires `ui:panel` and targets ONLY one of the plugin's own declared panels (own-panels-only); JSON-only payload capped at `MAX_PANEL_POST_BYTES = 64 KB`; delivered to the panel page as a `maestro:panelData` window message. One-way push - there is no reply channel back to the sandbox.
  - `ui.openPanel` / `ui.closePanel` / `ui.togglePanel`: requires `ui:panel` (no new consent); built by one shared factory and resolved through the SAME `deps.getPanel` lookup `ui.panelPost` uses, so a plugin can only summon its OWN panels. Non-`modal` placements are REJECTED (docked panels are always mounted, so open/close would be an untellable no-op). Registered only when `deps.panelVisibility` is wired (fail closed). Main broadcasts `plugins:panel-visibility` `{ pluginId, panelId, action }`; the renderer's App-level `PluginModalPanelMount` drives the `uiStore.openPluginPanelId` field (transient, namespaced `<pluginId>/<panelId>`), and `close` only closes when that exact panel is the open one.

  **Direct dispatch requires unattended consent.** The `agents.dispatch` handler additionally calls the injected `dispatchUnattendedAllowed(pluginId, agentId)` predicate (wired in `index.ts` to `isPermittedUnattended(grantsOf(pluginId), 'agents:dispatch', agentId)`) and denies the call unless the plugin holds the separate, revocable UNATTENDED grant on top of the interactive `agents:dispatch` allowlist grant. The time-based scheduler (`PluginSchedulerHost`) enforces the same unattended check independently and calls the dispatch SINK directly, so it is unaffected by this handler.

`PermissionRequest = { capability, scope?, reason? }`. Scopes narrow `fs:*` (a directory), `net:fetch` (a host), and `transcripts:read` (a project path); an absent scope means the broad form (the consent UI must present it as such). The user grants a subset at the consent dialog (`plugins:set-grants`).

## Contributions + registry merge

`collectContributions` validates one plugin's `contributes.*`; `aggregateContributions` merges across active plugins. Rules:

- Every contributed id is namespaced `<pluginId>/<localId>`. The manifest author writes the bare local `id`; the loader stores both `localId` and the namespaced `id`.
- Invalid individual items are dropped with a recorded error rather than failing the whole plugin (a typo in one theme must not hide good prompts).
- On a namespaced-id collision the first wins (defended even though ids are plugin-scoped). For runtime agents, built-in agents always win, so a plugin can never shadow a first-party agent.
- Contribution types: `themes`, `iconPacks`, `prompts`, `settings`, `commandMacros`, `cueTriggers` (tier 0); `commands`, `panels`, `agents`, `tools`, `keybindings` (tier 1). `cueTriggers` with `action: 'notify'` run on tier 0; `action: 'dispatch'` is risk-gated (the Pianola risk engine) and surfaced to the user, never auto-fired when high-risk. A `tools` contribution is invokable with a result via the brokered `plugins:invoke-tool` round-trip, and (when `plugins` is on) is exposed to a spawned agent's model over MCP via `maestro-cli mcp serve` (claude/codex auto-injected, others best-guess), each model call risk-gated. A `panels` contribution carries an optional `size?: 'default' | 'full'` (`modal` placement only, parsed leniently: absent -> `default` silently, invalid -> manifest error plus `default`, panel never dropped), where `full` renders edge-to-edge overlay chrome. A `keybindings` contribution's `command` must be a plugin-local id. Registering `agents`/`keybindings` does NOT by itself wire spawning / chord-binding - each is a separate step.
- `iconPacks` is a tier-0 contribution: the host validates SVG path data and hex colors, namespaces pack entries, and renders paths only through host-owned SVG markup in the group appearance picker.

- `hostViews` are data-only contributions available to tier-0 and tier-1 plugins: `{ id, surface: 'movement' | 'cadenza', title, description?, blocks? }`. `blocks` is an optional BlockView block array, serialized UTF-8 is capped at 1,000,000 bytes, and the host renderer - not plugin code - draws it. Tier-1 runtime update/remove RPCs require `ui:hostView`, resolve only an already-declared local id, retain its title/surface, and reject cadenza decision/options or agent-routing payloads.

- `uiItems` (tier 1) are declarative host-rendered controls gated by `ui:contribute`: `status-bar`, `menu`, `sidebar`, `activity-bar`, `toolbar`, `tabBar`, `sessionRowBadge`, `groupHeaderBadge`, `settingsSection`, `rightPanelTab`, `contextMenuItem`, and `emptyState`. Their `command` is plugin-local; content is only label/icon/tooltip data, never raw markup.

### Trusted chrome (never plugin-accessible)

`PROTECTED_UI_SURFACES` is an explicit denylist enforced while contributions are collected and again during aggregation; every `PluginUiItemsSlot` repeats the positive-allowlist check at the render boundary. Plugins must never target, nest into, replace, or visually occlude: (1) plugin management and enable/disable controls, (2) permission or consent dialogs, (3) uninstall or grant/revoke flows, or (4) security indicators, including SSH status, permission mode, and agent identity. Those semantic zones are deliberately absent from `PluginUiSurface`. `ui:render-unsafe` is subject to the same guard and does not unlock `ui:contribute` or `ui:panel`.

## IPC surface (`src/main/ipc/handlers/plugins.ts`)

Channels (all gated on `encoreFeatures.plugins`):

`plugins:list`, `plugins:set-enabled`, `plugins:install`, `plugins:update`, `plugins:uninstall`, `plugins:contributions`, `plugins:get-grants`, `plugins:set-grants`, `plugins:revoke-grants`, `plugins:invoke-command`, `plugins:invoke-tool`, `plugins:get-activity`. (Panel documents are NOT read over IPC - the render host serves them over the per-plugin `plugin-panel://` protocol; see below.)

- **Pure-reads invariant.** `plugins:list` and `plugins:contributions` MUST NOT call `refresh()`. `refresh()` reconciles sandboxes and fires `onChange` -> `plugins:changed` -> renderer re-fetch -> read again, an infinite IPC loop that freezes the app. Discovery happens at startup and on mutations only.
- **Consent (`plugins:set-grants`).** The user approves a SUBSET of the plugin's REQUESTED permissions. The handler intersects approved capabilities with the manifest's requests, so an over-broad grant can never be smuggled in via the renderer, and only known capabilities survive. `plugins:revoke-grants` calls `forgetGrants`.
- **Host-managed dispatch allow list (`plugins:set-agent-allowlist`, issue #1250).** `agents:dispatch` uses an allowlist scope naming the exact agent ids a plugin may target. The manifest declares the CAPABILITY; the USER owns the SCOPE. This channel is registered in `index.ts` (gated on the trusted main renderer + Encore flag, NOT this module, like `plugins:request-consent`) and re-mints the grant's scope through `AuthorizationStore.setAllowlistScope` - the same sealed-ledger path as consent/revoke, so the epoch bump, anti-rollback, tombstones, and session-only fallback are all preserved. It edits ONLY the scope of an ALREADY-CONSENTED capability: it never adds a capability, never touches the `unattended` flag, and never changes identity (the plugin's files are unchanged, so `verify()` still matches), so adding an agent needs no plugin re-pack/re-sign. The plugin can never reach it (a different principal), and submitted ids are intersected with live sessions and filtered through `isValidAllowlistMember`. Edited from Settings -> Plugins (the `AgentDispatchAllowlist` editor in a plugin's Permissions tab). A denied `agents.dispatch` (an out-of-date allow list) also raises a throttled operator toast, so it no longer fails invisibly.

## Renderer panel render host + consent

`PluginPanelFrame.tsx` is the ONE place a panel renders - an Electron `<webview>` guest, isolated per plugin (FC6 / WS-render-host):

- **Per-plugin session.** Partition `plugin:<pluginId>` (in-memory, never `persist:`), so a panel can never see the app's storage nor another plugin's, and everything dies on relaunch. Document URL `plugin-panel://panel/<encoded panelId>` - served by a per-session protocol handler in `plugin-panel-host.ts` (main), which re-checks the Encore flag + grant-gated contributions (`getPanelHtml`) on EVERY load and serves with a restrictive CSP **header + meta** (`connect-src 'none'`, `child-src/frame-src 'none'`, `form-action 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'`; inline script/style allowed, `img/font` `data:` only). Naming contract: `src/shared/plugins/panel-host.ts`.
- **Main-process enforcement.** `will-attach-webview` (window-manager) verifies partition and document name the SAME plugin, then forces web prefs: no Node, `contextIsolation`, OS `sandbox`, and the broker-only preload `plugin-panel-preload.js` (the ONLY preload; anything renderer-supplied is stripped). The session cancels ALL non-panel-document requests at the `webRequest` layer (egress denial beneath CSP) and denies every permission. `did-attach-webview` branches on `isPluginPanelSession`: panel guests get `window.open` denied and ALL navigations/redirects prevented - and NONE of the browser-tab conveniences (shortcut forwarding, JS injection, privileged paste) ever run inside plugin content. The old self-navigation exfil residual is CLOSED in the main process (the `will-frame-navigate` backstop in window-manager stays for the remaining srcdoc subframes, e.g. file preview).
- **Bridge (contract unchanged).** Panel HTML still calls `parent.postMessage({ type: 'maestro:invokeCommand', commandId, args }, '*')`. In a top-level guest `parent === window`; the guest preload (source-gated to the panel's own window) forwards that one shape via `ipcRenderer.sendToHost` -> `ipc-message` on the `<webview>` -> `PluginPanelFrame` namespaces it to `<pluginId>/<commandId>` and forwards over the broker-gated `plugins:invoke-command` RPC. One-way; no reply channel. A non-suppressible "from <plugin>" provenance line sits above every panel.

## Signing / trust

`signing.ts` + `plugin-signature.ts`. An optional `signature.json` (ed25519) covers a deterministic payload built from the SHA-256 of every other file in the plugin dir, so any tampering invalidates it. Statuses:

- `unsigned` - no signature.
- `invalid` - tampered or malformed signature. NEVER runnable.
- `untrusted` - valid signature, signing key not in the trusted set (integral but unknown publisher).
- `trusted` - valid signature, key in the trusted set.

Integrity ("files match what was signed") and trust ("key is recognized") are layered; a plugin can be integral-but-untrusted and still run once the user has enabled = consented.

### Bundled-plugin signing (release vs. dev)

Bundled plugins (e.g. `agent-flow`) ship trusted via a build-time signature, not a committed one. The private key is a CI secret (`MAESTRO_PLUGIN_SIGNING_KEY`); release CI writes it to a temp file, runs `maestro-cli plugin sign` over every dir in `examples/plugins/*/`, and packages the resulting `signature.json` into `<resources>/plugins/` via `extraResources`. The matching base64 SPKI public key is baked into `MAESTRO_PUBLISHER_KEYS` in `src/shared/plugins/publisher-keys.ts`, so those signatures resolve `trusted` and `seedBundledPlugins()` keeps the seeded copy. A drift guard in `.github/workflows/release.yml` re-validates the signed plugin against the baked anchor and fails the release if the CI secret and `publisher-keys.ts` ever diverge. The `signature.json` is a release artifact only - it is gitignored (`examples/plugins/*/signature.json`) and must never be committed.

**Testing Agent Flow (or any bundled code plugin) locally.** Dev builds have no CI secret and fall back to the unsigned repo `examples/plugins`, so `seedBundledPlugins()` finds the plugin `unsigned` and `continue`s before copying it into `pluginsDir()`. The plugin is never installed, so there is no panel and no `main.js` to run. (The distinct "panel renders but `main.js` never runs" symptom belongs to a plugin manually installed unsigned into `pluginsDir()` and then enabled - a different path from bundled seeding.) To exercise the real (signed, trusted) path in a dev build:

1. Generate a throwaway keypair and sign the dir: `maestro-cli plugin sign examples/plugins/agent-flow --gen-key --key-out ~/maestro-dev-publisher.pem`. This writes `signature.json` (gitignored) and prints the base64 SPKI public key.
2. Add that public key to `pluginTrustedKeys` in Settings. `resolveTrustedKeys()` merges your key with the baked anchor, so the local signature resolves `trusted` and the seeder keeps it.
3. Enable the plugin and grant consent; the panel now populates with live events.

**Trust model (v1): single key, no revocation.** `MAESTRO_PUBLISHER_KEYS` is an allow-list of accepted keys with no CRL. Rotation is additive-then-prune: add the new public key alongside the old, resign, ship a release, then drop the old entry in a later release once no shipped build still relies on it. A leaked private key can only be revoked by shipping a new release that rotates the anchor - there is no runtime revocation.

## Host-API semver contract

`HOST_API_VERSION` is a permanent public contract once plugins ship. PATCH = host bug fix; MINOR = additive (new contribution point / manifest field / capability, older plugins keep working); MAJOR = remove or change the meaning of an existing one. A plugin pins `maestro.minHostApi`; the host loads it only when same-major and `host >= min`.

The current host is `1.16.0`; it added the metadata-only `session.activated`
event topic, the `sessions.focus` method plus its narrow `sessions:focus`
capability, and the `ui.openPanel` / `ui.closePanel` / `ui.togglePanel` methods
plus the optional panel manifest field `size?: 'default' | 'full'`. (`1.15.0` is
taken by the Board + Profiles work on this fork, so it is skipped here.)
Earlier: `1.14.0` added the `tool.executed` event topic and the
`ui.panelPost` host-to-panel push method; `1.13.0` added the
host-mediated `PluginUiSurface` registry and trusted-chrome guard; `1.12.0`
added the `net:connect` capability and the `net.connect` / `net.send` /
`net.close` methods; `1.11.0` added `groupings` + `ui:grouping`; `1.10.0` added
`iconPacks`; `1.9.0` added `hostViews`, `ui:hostView`, and the
`ui.hostViewUpdate` / `ui.hostViewRemove` methods. Plugins declare the
`maestro.minHostApi` matching the lowest version whose surface they use.

## Key invariants and gotchas (read before editing)

1. **Encore gate everywhere.** Any new `plugins:*` channel must throw `'PluginsDisabled'` outside `withIpcErrorLogging` when the flag is off, and any manager method that exposes plugin data must return empty when disabled.
2. **Reads stay pure.** Never call `refresh()` from a read path - it reconciles sandboxes and loops via `plugins:changed`.
3. **Default deny.** Add a host method only by adding it to the `HOST_API` table with its capability; the broker derives authorization from that table. A method missing from the table is unreachable.
4. **fs is re-authorized after symlink resolution.** Never trust the raw path string; resolve the real path and re-`authorize`. The userData/config tree is excluded even under a broad grant.
5. **Net scope alone is not enough.** Hostname scope plus the egress guard (resolved-IP block list + connection pinning + `redirect: 'error'`) together defend `net:fetch`. Do not loosen any one of them in isolation.
6. **Events and sessions are metadata only.** Payloads NEVER contain transcript/prompt text or file contents. Redaction is not a boundary for free-form text. Content is reachable ONLY through the separate, consented, project-scoped, ActionGuard-bounded, audited `transcripts:read` capability - never the event bus.
7. **Built-in wins.** Plugin agents/contributions can never shadow first-party ids.
8. **Host views remain data-only.** A plugin may contribute or update only BlockView data for its own declared host view; it cannot supply HTML, renderer code, cadenza decision actions, or agent-routing data. Enforce `MAX_HOST_VIEW_BLOCKS_BYTES` in both declaration parsing and runtime updates.
9. **Uninstall purges everything** (dir, toggle, grants, KV, `plugins.<id>.*` settings, event subs). Add any new per-plugin state to `purgePluginData`.
10. **Live but fully gated.** `agents:dispatch`, `process:spawn`, and `net:connect` are wired and reachable, each behind the full gate stack (allowlist/host-scope grant + trusted signature + Pianola risk ceiling + ActionGuard + closed schema; `net:connect` adds wss-only + egress-pinning + socket/frame caps). The direct `agents.dispatch` handler additionally requires separate unattended consent. These conditions are pinned by the AST wiring guard (`plugin-host-deps-wiring.test.ts`): removing a gate, wiring a partial `net.connect` surface, or dropping `dispatchUnattendedAllowed` fails the build and forces a security review. Do not loosen any of them in isolation.
11. **Trusted chrome is permanent.** `PROTECTED_UI_SURFACES` applies to declarative items and every high-trust render tier in collection, aggregation, and at the render boundary. Never create a mount in plugin management/enable-disable, consent, uninstall/grant-revoke, or SSH/permission-mode/agent-identity chrome.

## Honest tier-1 trust model

The `vm` sandbox is realm-escapable. The intrinsics Maestro injects (the SDK, `console`, `setTimeout`) are host-realm functions, so `someInjected.constructor("return process")()` reaches the real `process`, and `codeGeneration.strings: false` only disables code-gen for the context's own `Function`, not the host's. The `vm` is DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH, never the boundary. The real controls are: the separate `utilityProcess` (process + crash isolation), the default-deny broker (which still gates ambient fs/net/exec authority), and signature/consent gating on which code runs at all. Closing the escape fully (an OS-level sandbox dropping ambient authority) is the documented Phase-3 decision. Until then, **enabling a tier-1 code plugin is a full-trust decision - only install plugins you trust.**

## Authoring surface (SDK + CLI)

External authors do not read this repo; two artifacts hand them the contract:

- **`@maestro/plugin-sdk`** (`packages/plugin-sdk/`) - a standalone, dependency-free package that VENDORS the frozen contracts (types, the small runtime values, and the `MaestroSdk` shape) so a plugin project type-checks against the same surface. A drift-guard test keeps the vendored copies in parity with `src/shared/plugins/`; bump the package version in lockstep with `HOST_API_VERSION`.
- **`maestro plugin` CLI** (`src/cli/commands/plugin.ts`) - `init` (scaffold), `validate` (manifest + signature status), `sign` (ed25519, payload byte-identical to `plugin-signature.ts`), `pack` (distributable tgz). See the authoring guide for the workflow.

## Virtual session groupings (HOST_API 1.9.0)

`contributes.groupings` adds a presentation-only sidebar mode. A tier-0 grouping
declares `{ id, label, description?, rules? }`; rules are first-match-wins and
may match `toolType`, `cwdGlob`, and `namePattern`, assigning display `group`
and optional `parentGroup` labels. Unmatched sessions appear in **Other**.
Patterns use only the bounded `*` wildcard grammar (all other characters are
literal); no plugin-supplied regular expression is compiled. Groupings never
write `session.groupId` or create, rename, or delete persisted groups.

Tier-1 code may publish a validated metadata-only snapshot through
`ui:grouping`: `maestro.ui.grouping.publish({ id, groups, assignments })` and
`maestro.ui.grouping.clear(id)`. The id must be this plugin's declared local
grouping id; group ids are local, depth is at most two, unknown session ids are
dropped, and snapshots are process-local and purged when the sandbox stops,
the plugin is disabled/uninstalled, or the feature flag is off. `ui:grouping`
is low-risk and unscoped because its only output is virtual presentation.
