# Tier 5 — Architecture mismatch (do not port)

Features that fundamentally don't fit the web/mobile architecture. Documenting them here so future contributors don't re-litigate the question.

## Items

| Feature | Why it doesn't port |
| --- | --- |
| Playbook editor | Mobile is read-only by design. Editor requires file system access, drag-drop file management. |
| Process Monitor (interactive) | Read-only display is Tier 2. Killing/sending signals to processes is desktop-anchored. |
| Execution queue admin | Reordering / canceling individual items is Tier 1 task 007. Bulk operations stay on desktop. |
| Session merge / transfer | Touches multiple windows, file system state. Architectural impedance mismatch. |
| Worktree create/delete (interactive) | Listed in Tier 4 but realistically belongs here unless an RFC reframes it. |
| Custom theme builder | Heavy color picker UI, persistence model, file export. Mobile uses synced themes from desktop only. |
| Keyboard shortcut editor | Mobile has no physical keyboard primary use case. Desktop owns shortcuts. |

## Default position

If a feature is being considered for mobile and it appears here, **the answer is no** unless a maintainer explicitly reverses the decision with rationale.

## Reversal process

If you believe a feature here should be ported:

1. Open an upstream issue describing the use case
2. Get maintainer agreement that mobile is the right surface for it
3. Move it to Tier 4 with an RFC
4. Then expand into task docs

Don't just author task docs and start working — these were placed here deliberately.

## What mobile *should* be

Mobile is the **remote control** for a desktop session. Read-mostly, low-friction, ergonomic for one-handed use. Anything that violates that thesis lives here.
