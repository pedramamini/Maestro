### ISSUE-001: Phone AI composer collapses into a clipped vertical strip for normal-length drafts

**Description**

On iPhone-sized viewports, the fixed bottom AI composer becomes too narrow once the user types a realistic prompt. The text wraps inside words, the top of the field is clipped out of view, and the user can only see the bottom portion of the draft. Expected: the main input stays readable and fully contained while growing. Actual: the input collapses into a thin, partially hidden column that makes phone prompting impractical.

**Repro Steps**

1. Open the remote dashboard on an iPhone-sized viewport and select an AI session.
   ![Step 1](screenshots/phone-ai-response.png)

2. Type a normal multi-clause prompt into the AI composer.
   ![Result](screenshots/issue-001-phone-composer-overflow.png)

**Current Retest Notes**

- The exact class of bug still reproduces on the current branch when the phone composer contains a realistic unsent draft. The field no longer collapses into the original razor-thin strip, but it still anchors too low and clips the visible draft so only the lower portion is readable.

  - `screenshots/phone-audit-back-to-ai-current.png`

**Post-Fix Verification**

- No longer reproducible in the working tree after switching the phone layout to a width-based stacked composer path.

### ISSUE-002: Switching from AI to CLI reuses the unsent AI draft as a shell command

**Description**

The mobile mode toggle carries the exact unsent AI draft into terminal mode instead of isolating AI and CLI buffers. Expected: switching to CLI should present an empty shell prompt or a terminal-specific draft buffer. Actual: the prior AI prompt instantly becomes terminal input, which creates a real risk of accidentally executing natural-language text as a shell command.

**Repro Steps**

1. In AI mode, type an unsent natural-language draft.
   ![Step 1](screenshots/phone-long-draft.png)

2. Tap the AI/CLI mode toggle.
   ![Result](screenshots/phone-terminal-after-switch.png)

**Current Retest Notes**

- On the current branch, switching from AI to CLI presents a clean shell input instead of reusing the unsent AI draft.
- Switching back from CLI to AI restores the original AI draft for that session.

### ISSUE-003: Switching sessions carries the unsent draft into the newly selected session

| **Retest Status On `7cfaded1`** | not reproducible via current session picker flow                                        |

**Description**

The mobile composer state is not scoped to the selected session. Expected: when the user switches to a different session, they should see that session's own draft state or an empty composer. Actual: the previous session's unsent draft appears unchanged in the next session, making it easy to send the wrong prompt to the wrong agent.

**Repro Steps**

1. In one AI session, type an unsent draft.
   ![Step 1](screenshots/phone-long-draft.png)

2. Tap another session in the session strip.
   ![Result](screenshots/phone-switch-other-session-with-draft.png)

**Current Retest Notes**

- Using the current `All Agents` picker, switching to another session no longer carries the unsent draft into the newly selected session.
- Returning to the original session restores the original draft.
