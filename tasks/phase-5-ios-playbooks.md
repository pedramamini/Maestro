# Phase 5: iOS Golden Path Playbooks

**Goal**: Create reusable, formalized playbook templates that turn common iOS development workflows into reliable, repeatable loops.

**Deliverable**: `iOS/` playbook set integrated with Maestro-Playbooks system.

**Dependency**: Phases 0-4 (full iOS tooling stack)

## Playbook Infrastructure

### Playbook Directory Structure

- [x] Create iOS playbook directory structure

  > Implemented via `ensurePlaybooksDirectory()` in playbook-loader.ts. Directory structure is created programmatically when the loader is initialized.

- [x] Create `src/main/ios-tools/playbook-loader.ts`
  - [x] Implement `loadPlaybook(name)` - load playbook configuration
  - [x] Implement `listPlaybooks()` - list available iOS playbooks
  - [x] Implement `validatePlaybook(config)` - validate playbook structure
  > Also implemented: `getPlaybookInfo()`, `playbookExists()`, `getPlaybookTemplatesDir()`, `getPlaybookBaselinesDir()`, and Common directory helpers.
