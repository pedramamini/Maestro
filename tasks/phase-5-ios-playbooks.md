  - [x] Implement progress reporting
  > Created comprehensive playbook runner with full implementation including:
  > - `runPlaybook()` - main entry point that loads, validates, and executes playbooks
  > - Step execution engine with `executeSteps()` and `executeStep()` for sequential/conditional step execution
  > - Variable resolution with `resolveValue()`, `resolveObject()`, and `evaluateExpression()` supporting template syntax (`{{ inputs.name }}`, `{{ outputs.build.bundle_id }}`, etc.)
  > - Loop handling with `executeLoopStep()` supporting array iteration (`loop: "{{ inputs.items }}"`, `as: "item"`) and range syntax (`range(5)`)
  > - Condition evaluation with `evaluateCondition()` for conditional step execution
  > - Artifact collection via integration with artifacts module and `collected` data accumulation
  > - Progress reporting via `onProgress` callback with phases: initializing, validating, executing, complete, failed
  > - Built-in actions: complete_loop, exit_loop, increment_iteration, wait, report_status, record_diff, record_crash, etc.
  > - Custom action handler support via `ActionRegistry`
  > - Result formatters: `formatPlaybookResult()` (markdown), `formatPlaybookResultAsJson()`, `formatPlaybookResultAsText()`, `formatPlaybookResultCompact()`
  > - 46 unit tests covering variable resolution, step execution, loops, conditions, error handling, and result formatting

### Slash Commands

- [x] Create `/ios.playbook` slash command
  - [x] `/ios.playbook list` - list available playbooks
  - [x] `/ios.playbook run <name>` - run a playbook
  - [x] `/ios.playbook info <name>` - show playbook details
  - [x] Arguments:
    - `--inputs <json>` - provide inputs
    - `--dry-run` - validate without executing
  > Created comprehensive `/ios.playbook` slash command (`src/main/slash-commands/ios-playbook.ts`) with full implementation including:
  > - `parsePlaybookArgs()` - argument parser supporting subcommands (list, run, info), flags (--dry-run, --continue), and options (--inputs, --simulator, --timeout)
  > - `executePlaybookCommand()` - main executor dispatching to list/run/info subcommands
  > - `executeListCommand()` - lists all available playbooks with metadata table (ID, description, version, type)
  > - `executeInfoCommand()` - shows detailed playbook info including inputs, variables, steps, validation status, and usage examples
  > - `executeRunCommand()` - executes a playbook with simulator resolution, input handling, and progress reporting
  > - Simulator UDID resolution for name-based targeting
  > - Rich markdown output formatting with error messages, troubleshooting hints, and examples
  > - Command metadata for autocomplete with 7 examples
  > - Exported from `slash-commands/index.ts` and registered in `slashCommands.ts` for UI autocomplete
  > - 37 unit tests covering argument parsing (subcommands, flags, inputs, quoted strings), command execution (list, info, run), metadata validation, and edge cases

### Auto Run Integration

- [ ] Enable playbooks in Auto Run documents
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Run regression check
    - ios.playbook: Regression-Check
      inputs:
        flows:
          - login_flow.yaml
          - purchase_flow.yaml
        baseline_dir: ./baselines
  ```

## IPC Handlers

- [ ] Add playbook IPC handlers to `src/main/ipc/handlers/ios.ts`
  - [ ] Register `ios:playbook:list` handler
  - [ ] Register `ios:playbook:run` handler
  - [ ] Register `ios:playbook:stop` handler
  - [ ] Register `ios:playbook:status` handler

---

## Testing

- [x] Write unit tests for playbook loader
  > 38 tests covering directory creation, playbook loading, validation, listing, and helper functions in `src/main/ios-tools/__tests__/playbook-loader.test.ts`
- [ ] Write unit tests for playbook runner
- [ ] Write integration tests for each playbook
- [ ] Test variable resolution
- [ ] Test loop handling
- [ ] Test error handling

## Documentation

- [ ] Document each playbook with examples
