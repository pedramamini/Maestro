## Previous Planning Documents

The user is continuing a previous planning session. Below are the existing Auto Run documents that were created earlier. Use these to understand what was already planned and continue from there. Your confidence should start higher (60-70%) since you have context from these documents.

{{EXISTING_DOCS}}

**Important:** When continuing from existing docs:
- Start with higher confidence (60-70%) since you already have context
- Review the existing plans and ask if anything has changed or needs updating
- Don't re-ask questions that are already answered in the documents
- Focus on validating the existing plan and filling in any gaps
