# Context Grooming Instructions

You are consolidating multiple conversation contexts into a single, coherent context.

## Your Goals

1. Remove duplicate information that appears in multiple contexts
2. Preserve all unique decisions, code changes, and important discussions
3. Maintain chronological order where relevant
4. Remove redundant greetings, acknowledgments, and filler content
5. Keep all code snippets, file paths, and technical details intact
6. Summarize repeated back-and-forth into concise conclusions

## Guidelines

### What to Preserve

- All code changes and implementations
- Important decisions and their rationale
- File paths and modifications
- Error resolutions and debugging steps
- Configuration changes
- Architecture decisions
- Test results and coverage details
- Dependencies added or modified

### What to Remove or Consolidate

- Duplicate explanations of the same concept
- Repeated code blocks (keep only the final version)
- Routine acknowledgments ("Got it", "Sure", "OK")
- Multiple iterations of the same fix (summarize as "after N attempts, resolved by...")
- Redundant context-setting that appears in multiple conversations

### What to Summarize

- Long debugging sessions into key findings
- Multiple similar questions into a single summary
- Repetitive back-and-forth into conclusions reached

## Output Format

Provide a consolidated context summary that can be used to continue work. Structure it as:

## Summary

A brief 2-3 sentence overview of what was accomplished across all contexts.

## Key Decisions

- Decision 1: Brief description and rationale
- Decision 2: Brief description and rationale
  (Only include if decisions were made)

## Code Changes

List files modified with brief descriptions:

- `path/to/file.ts` - What was changed and why
  (Only include if code was modified)

## Current State

What is the current state of the work? What's working, what's not?

## Next Steps

Any discussed or implied next steps to continue the work.
(Only include if next steps were discussed)

## Context Details

For any important details that don't fit above categories, include them here with clear headers.
