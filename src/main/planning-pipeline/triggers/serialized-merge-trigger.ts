/**
 * serialized-merge-trigger.ts
 *
 * Concrete trigger handler that fires when a work item transitions INTO
 * `fork-merged` inside the Planning Pipeline.
 *
 * Responsibility: invoke a `MergeRunner` to perform the actual PR merge and
 * emit the result via the optional `onMergeResult` callback.  Crucially, merge
 * calls are *serialized* — only one merge runs at a time even if multiple
 * `review-approved → fork-merged` events fire concurrently.  This matches the
 * lesson learned from the Symphony autonomous loop where parallel merges caused
 * extended conflict storms (30+ minutes of remediation).
 *
 * Serialization design:
 *   A private `Promise<void>` chain field is maintained inside the factory
 *   closure.  When a new event arrives the trigger enqueues a new unit of work
 *   that `await`s the previous chain before calling `runner.runMerge`.  If the
 *   previous unit threw, the error is caught so the chain continues.  The
 *   overall handler resolves immediately (fire-and-forget from the bus's
 *   perspective); the enqueued work settles asynchronously and emits
 *   `onMergeResult` when done.
 *
 * Registration scope: `fork-merged` can only be reached from `review-approved`
 * (per `PIPELINE_TRANSITIONS`).  Both the predecessors and the target stage are
 * derived at module-load time so the set stays correct automatically if the
 * transition table gains additional edges.
 *
 * Error contract:
 *   - Runner errors are caught, logged, and reported via `onMergeResult` with
 *     `{ merged: false, reason: '<error message>' }`.  They are NEVER
 *     re-thrown — the registry already isolates handler failures; swallowing
 *     here provides belt-and-suspenders and ensures the serialization chain
 *     survives individual runner failures.
 *   - `onMergeResult` errors are caught and logged but do not affect the
 *     overall chain or the handler resolution.
 *
 * @see src/main/planning-pipeline/trigger-registry.ts  — registry contract
 * @see src/shared/planning-pipeline-types.ts           — PIPELINE_TRANSITIONS
