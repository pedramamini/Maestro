/**
 * restart-recovery.ts
 *
 * recoverPipelineState — reconciles in-flight pipeline items on app startup.
 *
 * On boot, after the Work Graph is initialized, call `recoverPipelineState(deps)`
 * to walk every in-flight work item and reconcile its pipeline state:
 *
 *   - Claim EXPIRED and stage is a "claimed" stage → release the claim and
 *     roll back the stage to its predecessor (e.g. `runner-active` → `agent-ready`).
 *   - Claim is still VALID (or absent) → leave the item untouched.
 *
 * Rolling back rather than dead-lettering gives the dispatch engine a clean
 * opportunity to re-pick up the item as soon as the tick fires, without manual
 * intervention.  The supervisor (#253) will handle the dead-letter path if the
 * same item expires again after retry-budget exhaustion.
 *
 * Design decisions:
 *   - Per-item errors are swallowed so one broken item never blocks recovery of
 *     the rest.
 *   - `now()` is injectable so tests are fully deterministic.
 *   - No dependency on the event bus or supervisor — this is a one-shot
 *     function called before those loops start.
 *
 * @see pipeline-supervisor.ts — ongoing expired-claim handling (post-boot)
 * @see sla-types.ts           — SlaConfig / SlaBreach for SLA layer
