Maestro includes a built-in web server for mobile remote control:

1. **Automatic Security** — Web server runs on a random port with an auto-generated security token (UUID) embedded in the URL
2. **QR Code Access** — Scan a QR code to connect instantly from your phone
3. **Live Sessions** — Sessions marked as "live" become accessible through the web interface (protected by the security token)
4. **Remote Tunneling** — Access Maestro from anywhere via Cloudflare tunnel (requires `cloudflared` CLI)

## Mobile Web Interface

The mobile web interface provides a comprehensive remote control experience:

### Core Features

- Real-time session monitoring and command input
- Device color scheme preference support (light/dark mode)
- Connection status indicator with automatic reconnection (30-second countdown timer)
- Offline queue for commands typed while disconnected (persisted to localStorage, up to 50 commands)
- Multi-tab support with tab bar and tab search modal

### Gestures and Navigation

- Swipe gestures (left/right/up/down) for common actions
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Long-press menu for mode switching (AI ↔ Terminal)

### Input Features

- Recent command chips for quick access
- Slash command autocomplete
- Command history drawer

## Local Access (Same Network)

1. Click the **OFFLINE** button in the Left Bar header to enable the web interface
2. The button changes to **LIVE** (pulsing) and a QR code overlay appears automatically
3. Scan the QR code or copy the secure URL to access from your phone on the same network

<Note>
The web interface uses your local IP address (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) for LAN accessibility. Both devices must be on the same network.
</Note>

## Remote Access (Outside Your Network)

To access Maestro from outside your local network (e.g., on mobile data or from another location):

1. Install cloudflared: `brew install cloudflared` (macOS) or [download for other platforms](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
2. Enable the web interface (**OFFLINE** → **LIVE**)
3. Toggle **Remote Access** in the Live overlay panel
4. A secure Cloudflare tunnel URL (e.g., `https://abc123.trycloudflare.com`) will be generated within ~30 seconds
5. Use the **Local/Remote** pill selector to switch between QR codes
6. The tunnel stays active as long as Maestro is running — no time limits, no Cloudflare account required

<Tip>
The Remote tab automatically activates when the tunnel connects successfully.
</Tip>

## Custom Port Configuration

By default, Maestro assigns a **random port** each time the web server starts. This is a security-by-obscurity measure — attackers can't easily guess which port to target.

However, if you need a **fixed port** (e.g., for firewall rules, reverse proxies, or persistent tunnel configurations), you can enable custom port mode:

1. Click the **LIVE** button to open the Live overlay panel
2. Toggle **Custom Port** to enable static port mode
3. Enter your desired port number (1–65535)
4. The server restarts automatically on the new port

**Use cases for custom ports:**

- Punching a hole through a firewall or NAT
- Configuring a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy)
- Setting up persistent SSH tunnels
- Integration with home automation systems

<Warning>
**Security Trade-off**: Using a custom port removes one layer of security-by-obscurity. The randomized port and auto-generated auth token in the URL work together to protect access. With a custom port, you're relying solely on the auth token for security.

**Recommendations when using custom ports:**

- Use Cloudflare tunnel for remote access instead of exposing ports directly
- Ensure your network firewall is properly configured
- Consider additional authentication at the network level
  </Warning>

## Connection Handling

The mobile interface includes robust connection management:

### Automatic Reconnection

- When disconnected, a 30-second countdown timer displays before automatic reconnection
- Manual **Retry** button available for immediate reconnection
- Reconnection attempts counter shows progress (e.g., "Attempt 3 of 10")

### Offline Mode

- Commands typed while offline are queued (up to 50 commands)
- Queued commands are persisted to localStorage and survive page reloads
- Commands automatically send when connection is restored
- An **Offline Queue Banner** shows the number of pending commands

### Connection Status Indicator

- Displays as a dismissible banner when connection is lost
- Shows different states: **Connecting**, **Authenticating**, **Disconnected**, **No internet**
- Expandable error details for troubleshooting
