Director's Notes is your bird's-eye view of everything happening across all your AI agents. Instead of switching between tabs to check what each agent has been doing, Director's Notes aggregates all history entries into a single, searchable, filterable timeline — and can generate an AI-powered synopsis of recent activity.

## Opening Director's Notes

**Keyboard shortcut:**
- macOS: `Cmd+Shift+O`
- Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+O`

**From Quick Actions:**
- Press `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` and search for "Director's Notes"

## Tabs

Director's Notes has three tabs:

### Unified History

The primary view — a chronological list of all history entries from every agent, newest first.

**Filtering:**
- **AUTO / USER** toggle buttons filter by entry type
- **Search** (`Cmd+F` / `Ctrl+F`) filters by summary text or agent name
- **Activity Graph** shows entry distribution over time; right-click to change the lookback window (24 hours through all time)

**Stats Bar:**
A centered aggregate stats bar displays key metrics across the current dataset:
- Total queries, sessions, AUTO entries, USER entries, and total cost

**Entry Details:**
Each entry shows:
- **Agent name** — which Maestro agent produced the entry
- **Task name pill** — clickable link to the originating session
- **Type badge** (AUTO or USER)
- **Summary** of what was accomplished
- **Duration** and **cost** (when available)
- **Timestamp**

Click any entry to open the **Detail Modal** with full response text, token breakdown, and navigation controls (Prev/Next or arrow keys).

**Session Navigation:**
Click the session pill on any entry to jump directly to that agent's tab — Director's Notes closes and focuses the agent with the relevant session loaded.

**Infinite Scroll:**
Entries load progressively (100 at a time). Scroll to load more as needed.

### AI Overview

An AI-generated synopsis of recent activity across all agents. This tab uses a configurable AI provider to read history files and produce a structured report.

**Controls:**
- **Lookback slider** — Adjust from 1 to 90 days to control the analysis window
- **Refresh** — Regenerate the synopsis with current settings
- **Save** — Export the synopsis as a markdown file
- **Copy** — Copy the raw markdown to clipboard

**Stats Bar:**
After generation, a stats bar shows:
- Number of history entries analyzed
- Number of agents with activity
- Generation time

**Synopsis Content:**
The AI produces a structured report organized by agent/project with sections for:
- **Accomplishments** — What was completed
- **Challenges** — Issues encountered or unresolved
- **Next Steps** — Recommended follow-up actions

The synopsis is rendered as rich markdown with full formatting support.

**Provider Configuration:**
Configure which AI provider generates the synopsis in **Settings > Director's Notes**. Any installed agent (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) can be used. The default lookback window is also configurable there.

<Note>
The AI Overview tab becomes available once the synopsis has finished generating. A spinning indicator on the tab shows generation is in progress. Results are cached for the session — switching tabs won't trigger a regeneration.
